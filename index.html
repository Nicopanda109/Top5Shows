                Street-wise Max (Kat Dennings) doesn't expect much from the new waitress at her night job, a rich girl
                who has
                reluctantly joined the food service industry after a string of bad luck. But to her surprise, Caroline
                (Beth Behrs) is a
                woman of substance and just may be her ticket to success. The two strike up an unlikely friendship after
                Caroline
                discovers that Max can bake a mean cupcake, and the women decide if they can just wrangle up the
                start-up cash, they may
                have found their big break. Their co-workers at the diner are boss Han Lee, cook Oleg and cashier Earl.

                Mensa-fied best friends and roommates Leonard and Sheldon, physicists who work at the California
                Institute of
                Technology, may be able to tell everybody more than they want to know about quantum physics, but getting
                through most
                basic social situations, especially ones involving women, totally baffles them. How lucky, then, that
                babe-alicious
                waitress/aspiring actress Penny moves in next door. Frequently seen hanging out with Leonard and Sheldon
                are friends and
                fellow Caltech scientists Wolowitz and Koothrappali. Will worlds collide? Does Einstein theorize in the
                woods?

            <p>
                Bob, a middle-aged compression sock businessman from Detroit, unexpectedly falls for his cardiac nurse
                while recovering
                from a heart attack and sets his sights on winning her over. Undaunted by Abishola's lack of initial
                interest or the
                vast differences in their backgrounds -- she's originally from Nigeria -- Bob is determined to win
                Abishola's heart in
                this comedic examination of immigrant life in America. From award-winning creator, executive producer
                and writer Chuck
